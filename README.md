# Finothon 2024: Real-World SMS Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to our project repository for **Finothon 2024**! This project focuses on analyzing real-world SMS data to derive insightful financial trends and relationships. We developed this project during the Finothon hackathon to showcase the potential of data analysis in improving financial literacy and decision-making.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of our project was to:
- Analyze SMS data to extract financial information related to credit and debit transactions.
- Visualize the relationships and patterns in the data using interactive and comprehensive graphs.
- Provide insights into user spending and earning trends.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Google Colaboratory**: For collaborative coding and data analysis.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data processing and analysis.
  - **Seaborn**: For creating statistical data visualizations.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Features
1. **Data Extraction**
   - Parsed SMS data to identify financial transactions.
   - Categorized transactions as credit or debit based on keywords and patterns.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Removed irrelevant data entries.
   - Normalized transaction amounts for accurate analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Created various relational graphs to display:
     - Trends in credited vs. debited amounts.
     - Spending patterns over time.
     - Correlations between transaction amounts and categories.
   - Employed Seaborn for visually appealing and easy-to-understand graphs.

## Key Insights
- The data revealed user spending habits, such as peak spending days and the proportion of credited vs. debited transactions.
- Visualizations highlighted areas where users could optimize their financial management.

## How to Run the Project
```bash
# Clone this repository
